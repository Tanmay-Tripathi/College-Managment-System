# College-Managment-System
This is a personal beginner project that utilizes Python and MySQL database to create and maintain a basic college management system.
The system can store and manage data related to students,teachers and attendance. 
This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn Python and database management. 

# Python 
Command Line interface is designed using python and is kept really simple so that people can easily learn how everything works.
Connection between mysql database and python was established by mysql connector python lib.
Downloading of the attendance was done by File handling feature of python.

# SQL database
There were 2 database designed 
1. User - to store the username password and type of account to give priviledge to the loged in user.
2. Attendance - so that attendance of the students can be marked and stored and later different queries can be performed. 

# Feel free to explore the code and make contributions to enhance its functionality.
